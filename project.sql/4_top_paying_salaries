Based on the analysis in the data_engineer_skills.md file, here are the key insights presented in three bullet points:

The "Hybrid" Engineer: The highest-paying skills are often not traditional data engineering tools, but rather technologies from other fields like web development (Node.js, Vue) and blockchain (Solidity). This indicates a growing demand for data engineers who can build user-facing applications or work in emerging tech domains.

Core Infrastructure Matters: In addition to new skills, a strong foundation in core infrastructure and DevOps is still highly valued. Skills like Kubernetes for container orchestration and a deep understanding of command-line tools (Ubuntu, Shell) and specific cloud services (CodeCommit) are essential for building scalable and robust data systems.

Real-time and Specialized Data: The data shows a premium on expertise in real-time data streaming (Kafka) and specialized databases (MongoDB, Cassandra). This confirms the shift towards handling unstructured data and building event-driven architectures to support real-time analytics and business operations.
